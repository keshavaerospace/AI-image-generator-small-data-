Hello Everyone,
This is an AI Image Generator Model which is light on GPU and can be run on any environment.
I ran it on Google collab, you can use it too.
I have used Hugging Face's Diffuser Library to run Stable Diffusion 2 in a simple and efficient manner.
I made this project to understand generative models.
Not all images can be genrated here because of the low GPU use(small Image Library).
