Hello Everyone,
This is an AI Image Generator Model which is light on GPU and can be run on any environment.
I used Google collab, you can use it too.
I have used Hugging Face's Diffuser Library to run Stable Diffusion 2 in a simple and efficient manner.
I made this project to understand generative models.
Not all images can be genrated here because of the low GPU use(small Image Library).
The model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.
